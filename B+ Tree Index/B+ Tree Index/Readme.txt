## Overview

In this assignment, we developed a B+-tree index, structured to store and manage data efficiently in a
 sorted order using a buffer manager to optimize memory usage. Key functions include `insertKey()` 
 to add entries, `findKey()` to search for specific keys, and `deleteKey()` to remove them, all while 
 maintaining the treeâ€™s balance. Additionally, `openTreeScan()` and `nextEntry()` allow for sequentially
  scanning entries in sorted order. The B+-tree is built to handle edge cases like duplicate keys and 
  underflows, ensuring robust and reliable performance.

1. Contents of the folder
Below is the list of files that are present in the Assignment folder.
.c files:
btree_mgr.c, buffer_mgr_stat.c, buffer_mgr.c, dberror.c, expr.c, h_needed.c, record_mgr.c, rm_serializer.c, storage_mgr.c, test_assign4_1.c and test_expr.c

.h or header files:
btree_mgr.h, buffer_mgr_stat.h, buffer_mgr.h, dberror.h, dt.h, expr.h, record_mgr.h, storage_mgr.h, tables.h, test_helper.h 

2. Compilation and Execution

Compilation Steps:
1. Intially execute "make clean" command to remove any execution files if present.
2. Give "make test_assign4" command to create the executable files for test_assign4_1.
3. Give "make run" command to run test_assign4_1
4. Give "make test_expr" command to create the executable files for test_expr
5. Give "make run_expr" command to run test_expr


3. Functional Description

Index Initialization and Termination

initIndexManager(): Initializes the necessary resources for managing the B+-tree index.

shutdownIndexManager(): Releases resources once the index manager is no longer required.

B+-Tree Index Operations

createBtree(): Initializes a new B+-tree index and stores it in a file managed by the storage manager.

openBtree(): Opens an existing B+-tree index for both reading and writing operations.

closeBtree(): Commits any changes and closes the currently open B+-tree index.

deleteBtree(): Completely removes an existing B+-tree index from the system.

Retrieving B+-Tree Details

getNumNodes(): Retrieves the total count of nodes (pages) present in the B+-tree.

getNumEntries(): Returns the total number of key-value pairs stored in the B+-tree.

getKeyType(): Indicates the data type of keys used within the B+-tree (e.g., integer).

Key Management Operations

findKey(): Looks up a specific key and returns its associated Record ID (RID) if it exists.

insertKey(): Adds a new key and its corresponding Record ID to the B+-tree; returns an error if the key is already present.

deleteKey(): Removes a key and its associated Record ID from the B+-tree.

Tree Traversal

openTreeScan(): Starts a scan over B+-tree entries that meet a defined condition.

nextEntry(): Fetches the next entry in the ongoing scan; signals completion when no further entries match.

closeTreeScan(): Terminates the scan and frees any resources that were allocated for it.
